              Hi Everyone!👋🏼 <br />
              I'm Jananadi, a beginner landscape and digital artist.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started painting as a hobby in 2020, (Yes, the time we all discovered our inner self 🧘🏻‍♀️) <br />
              As a programmer, painting is a great new world for me, and put my creativity into life.
            </p>

            <p>
              I use watercolors, acrylic and oil paint & recently I've started doing more and more digital art. <br />
              <br />
              To display my art and share my journey, I developed this little site. 👩🏻‍💻{' '}
